x-slug: avin-code
description: AVIN is essentially the equivalent of an ISBN for wine bottles. That
  is a unique number which identifies a bottle of wine by producer, grape, vintage.
  The AVIN is now being printed in over 25 million wine labels.AVINs make a specific
  wine easier to find. An AVIN is a 13 digit number which looks like this AVIN6452997073019.
  The number is stored in a large database with all the details of the wine. A wine
  can then be referred to by its AVIN through Google, stock control systems or anywhere
  else. It starts to become more interesting when an AVIN is blended with something
  else.Just one of the interesting ways in which AVINs are being used is with QR codes.
  By providing a QR code, you are creating a dynamic or interactive wine label which
  brings the wine drinker to a page with information from several different wine sites
  and includes reviews, prices and other information.
